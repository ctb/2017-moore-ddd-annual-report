## Progress

*Describe your project's progress in the last year. Please reference your initial project objectives when possible.*

Award purpose:

"""
In support of demonstrating the high level of scientific impact
that data scientists deliver through their focus on
interdisciplinary data-driven research; funds from this award will
be used to better understand gene function in non-model organisms
through the development of new workflows and better data sharing
technology for large-scale data analysis.
"""

The second year of this award saw substantial progress towards
outlining a strategy and developing specific foundational technologies
and software.  (The first year of this award was dominated by the
process of moving to UC Davis and recruiting postdocs to my new lab!)
Since last report, three new postdocs (Daniel Standage, Harriet
Alexander, and Phillip Brooks) have joined, and all are working on
DDD-related projects.

We are now moving forward on several fronts:

* we have a transcriptomics team working on reanalysis of 700
  transcriptomes (MMETSP project, Lisa Cohen and Harriet Alexander)
  using technology developed by Camille Scott (dammit and shmlast).
  In addition to the primary products (new & better assemblies), we
  have a robust, quality-controlled open and canonical de novo
  assembly and annotation pipeline that can be applied to any
  eukaryotic RNAseq data set.

* a metagenomics group (Sherine Awad, Phil Brooks) is moving towards
  the same goal in metagenomics data analysis.
  
* our distributed/scalability tiger team (Luiz Irber) is working to
  build distributed indices of MinHash sketches to make it possible to
  find relevant data sets and analyses.  As part of this Luiz is building
  a massively scalable indexing infrastructure that resembles a botnet.
  
* our core software development efforts are proceeding again, with
  Daniel Standage leading khmer development and a consultant (Tim Head)
  contributing to development, code review, and testing.

* while doing all of this, we continue to explore the landscape of
  tools and resources around notions of openness, repeatability,
  decentralization and distribution, and community engagement.  In
  addition to my own robust social media presence, an analysis of
  challenges in doing large scale data reanalysis on a small lab
  budget will be submitted along with the primary MMETSP reanalysis
  paper.

* an important component of all our work is a teaching and training
  effort that is aimed at building a local community of practice around
  data-driven discovery while engaging with the global community
  being nucleated by the Data Science Environments and Data Carpentry.
  Towards this end we have run dozens of workshops in the past two years
  and plan to considerably scale up in the summer of 2017.
  
It's hard to predict where we will end up but I'm enjoying the ride.

### Help requested

#### Compute infrastructure

There is a general confusion and lack of clarity around the
computational infrastructure needs of Data Driven Discovery, and where
and how to meet them.  This includes just-in-time resources for
training, long term storage of large datasets, "scale out" technology
options, good-enough practice in making use of the options, and
funding/support for large scale compute and storage.  (This is also
alluded to in Casey Greene's report.)  

We are working on a local (UC Davis School of Vet Med) solution to
container hosting, and also starting to interact more closely with
NSF's JetStream, as two possible solutions for our lab.

But, more generally, I don't know what a sustainable option is here.
It seems like a good opportunity for some brainstorming.

#### Learning about deep learning

I need to know more about deep learning, and gain some hands on
experience.  More, I would like to be able to engage closely with
experts in order to figure out what will and won't work. People in my
lab are also interested in this. Where do we go?
